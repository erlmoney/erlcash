# epool
Erlcash - Massively scalable cryptocurency written in Erlang

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ergenius/erlcash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ergenius/erlcach)

ErlCash is an **insanely documented** **cryptocurrency** with a focus on **privacy**, **performance**, **extensibility** and **functionality**.

ErlCash is written from **scratch** in Erlang. Erlcash is NOT another shitcoin but a genuine effort to create a genuine original cryptocurrency.

## Motivation

That's why I decided to **insanely** document the code so that any Erlang beginner can understand it.

## Project roadmap

1. Continuously fix bugs and tune performance.
2. Write more testing units.

## Erlang versions supported

Epool officially supports OTP release 17 and later.

Development of Epool takes place using a OTP 19.3 release and tests are done on:
- 17.5
- 18.3
- 19.3
- 20.0

Unofficially you may be able to use Epool with older Erlang versions. No guarantee included.

## Dependencies

I didn't like to have any project dependencies that can easily introduce versioning conflicts in bigger applications that use the same dependencies. Epool uses only standard OTP, no other application is needed and will ever be.
